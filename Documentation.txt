## Introduction
This document serves as comprehensive documentation for the React-based banking application. It is intended for developers and users to understand the application's features, architecture, and development process.

## Application Overview
The React Banking Application is a web-based platform designed to offer a range of banking services in a secure, user-friendly environment. It aims to simplify personal and business banking needs through digital solutions.

## Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: Developed using React.js, the application employs Redux for state management and Tailwind CSS for styling.
- **Backend**: (If applicable) Node.js with Express.js framework is used for the backend, handling API requests and business logic.
- **Database**: MongoDB for NoSQL storage of user data, account details, etc.
- **External APIs**: Integration with third-party services for payment processing, credit scoring, etc.

## Getting Started
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-banking-app.git`
- Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies: `cd your-banking-app && npm install`
- Start the development server: `npm start`

## Features
- **Account Management**: View and manage personal and business accounts.
- **Loan Processing**: Apply for and manage personal and business loans.
- **Investment Services**: Explore and utilize various investment options.
- **Secure Transactions**: Enhanced security for all transactions.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and user authentication process.

## Code Examples
- **Functional Component Example**: 
  ```jsx
  const AccountDetails = ({ account }) => (
    <div>
      <h3>{account.name}</h3>
      <p>Balance: {account.balance}</p>
    </div>
  );
  ```
- **Redux Action and Reducer Example**: 
  ```javascript
  // Action
  const fetchAccountSuccess = account => ({ type: 'FETCH_ACCOUNT_SUCCESS', account });

  // Reducer
  const accountReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'FETCH_ACCOUNT_SUCCESS':
        return { ...state, account: action.account };
      default:
        return state;
    }
  };
  ```
- **API Integration Example**:
  ```javascript
  fetch('/api/accounts')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(account => console.log(account));
  ```

## Testing
- **Unit Testing**: Using Jest along with React Testing Library for component tests.
- **Integration Testing**: Testing combined parts of the application for integrated workflow.
- **E2E Testing**: Using tools like Cypress for end-to-end testing (if applicable).

## Deployment
- Build the application for production: `npm run build`
- Deploy the build on platforms like AWS, Heroku, or Netlify following their respective guidelines.

## Contributing
- **Coding Standards**: Follow ESLint rules specified in the project.
- **Pull Request Process**: Ensure code passes all tests before submitting a pull request. Include detailed descriptions of changes.
- **Branch Naming Convention**: Use a descriptive name, e.g., `feature/add-loan-calculator`.

## FAQs
